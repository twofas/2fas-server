# Open Source 2FAS API

This is the official server-side API for the Open Source 2FAS project.

## What is 2FAS?

2FAS (Two-Factor Authentication Service) is a user authentication method that provides an additional layer of security for online accounts. In addition to a username and password, 2FAS uses a second factor, such as a one-time password (OTP) shown on a user's phone, to verify a user's identity. This helps prevent unauthorized access to accounts, even if a password is compromised.

## Features

- Connecting the 2FAS app with the 2FAS browser extension (API and websocket API)
- Connecting to the 2FAS icons system
- Connecting to 2FAS support (receiving debug log files)
- Sending in-app notifications to 2FAS app users
- Other miscellaneous features
